"""
This script manages the process of creating and modifying a database in the context of a simulated iOS environment.
It interacts with a SQLite database, and takes user input for the number of history and bookmark records to create,
and for naming the new database file. The script uses the `websites.csv` file located in the same directory to
generate records and insert them into the database. The `websites.csv` file contains the top 1000 work-safe websites
and is used by default.

If you want to add your own custom websites, then create a csv file in this directory with those websites. You can use
the `websites.csv` file as a template. You'll just need to change the constant `CSV_FILE` to the name of the csv file you
want to use.

PLEASE NOTE:
In order for this script to work, you must have an iOS Simulator instance open with a build of firefox-ios installed.
This script looks for a booted Simulator device with an app loaded whose BUNDLE_ID is 'org.mozilla.ios.Fennec' and
assumes you want to copy the 'places.db' database.

This also assumes you ONLY HAVE ONE BOOTED SIMULATOR INSTANCE open as it will only return the first instance it finds.

The script currently doesn't support modifications to:
    - autofill.db
    - browser.db
    - ReadingList.db
though it may in the future.
